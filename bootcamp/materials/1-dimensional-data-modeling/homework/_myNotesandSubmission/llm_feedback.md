## Feedback on Submission

### Overall Review

Your submission for the database setup and SQL operations demonstrates a good understanding of basic SQL operations, the use of common table expressions (CTEs), and how to handle Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) for maintaining historical data. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each task:

### Task 1 (`task_1.sql`)

- **Actors Table Creation**: 
  - You correctly created the `actors` table with appropriate columns, including a JSONB type for `films`. This allows for the storage of complex data related to films, which is a good approach for flexibility.
  
  **Feedback**: Well done on the table structure. Ensure your data types align with your data usage.

### Task 2 (`task_2.sql`)

- **Insertions into Actors Table**:
  - You used CTEs to aggregate film data and determine the quality class based on ratings, which is an efficient way to organize your data manipulation.

  **Feedback**: You showed excellent usage of `jsonb_agg` for collecting film-related data. The use of case logic for the `quality_class` indicator is clear and easy to understand.

### Task 3 (`task_3.sql`)

- **Actors History SCD Table Creation**:
  - The structure of this table aligns well with requirements for storing historical data. The fields are appropriate for maintaining an SCD.

  **Feedback**: Excellent table structure for SCD needs, using start and end dates to capture periods of actor data effectively.

### Task 4 (`task_4.sql`)

- **Insertion into Actors History SCD**:
  - You correctly used window functions like `LAG` and `LEAD` to track changes over time, which are well-suited for this task.

  **Feedback**: Your understanding of tracking changes and using window functions to detect transitions in data is commendable. The logic is well-crafted to catch new and altered entries.

### Task 5 (`task_5.sql`)

- **Handling SCD Changes**:
  - The usage of FULL OUTER JOIN and conditions that consider when to start a new record or update an existing one is well thought out.

  **Feedback**: The logic to differentiate new records and changes is good. Ensure thorough testing for edge cases like missing actor IDs or data inconsistencies.

### General Remarks

- **Correctness**: Your SQL scripts perform the expected tasks effectively. The logic flows well between tasks, maintaining integrity and structure in the database.
- **Efficiency**: Using CTEs for data manipulation and aggregation is efficient. The performance should be satisfactory for the dataset size presumed in the setup.
- **Error Handling**: For future improvements, consider error handling within scripts or comments on how to handle potential pitfalls.

### Additional Suggestions

- **Documentation**: Include comments in your scripts to describe the purpose and the logic behind each major step or query section. It will be helpful for readability and maintenance.
- **Testing**: Consider setting up test cases or scenarios that evaluate your SQL scripts' effectiveness and edge case handling.
