Hello,

Thank you for your submission. Let's review each component of your work based on the assignment requirements:

1. **Backfill Query Conversion**:
   - You've successfully converted PostgreSQL queries related to the `actors_history_scd` and `hosts_cumulated` transformations to SparkSQL. Both queries effectively use CTEs to manage intermediate transformations and handle Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) concepts where applicable.

2. **PySpark Job**:
   - **actors_scd_job.py (HW3_2_1.py)**:
     - Your PySpark job handles the transformation for the `actors_history_scd` table well. The logic used for identifying changes in `quality_class` and `is_active` is correctly applied.
     - Your use of window functions (`LAG`) and the calculation of `streak_identifier` is a suitable approach for identifying changes over time.

   - **hosts_cumulated_job.py (HW3_2_4.py)**:
     - This job manages the transformation for updating `host_activity_datelist` as expected.
     - The separation of current and updated hosts with the use of `UNION ALL` ensures both new and existing host activity data is captured.

3. **Tests**:
   - **Test for `actors_history_scd` (HW3_2_2.py)**:
     - The test accurately creates fake input data and compares the actual transformation against expected outputs using `chispa` for dataframe comparison.
     - Your use of named tuples for test data helps with clarity and maintainability.

   - **Test for `hosts_cumulated` (HW3_2_3.py)**:
     - Similarly, the test for `hosts_cumulated` handles the expected logic well. It uses both existing and new hosts to validate the transformation.
     - The `assert_df_equality` function from `chispa` is used properly to ensure the output is as expected.

4. **General Observations**:
   - Your code follows good practices, with clearly defined functions and organized job and test scripts.
   - Considerations for potential exceptions are handled using try-except blocks.
   - You make good use of Spark SQL capabilities, which enhances the readability and efficiency of your Spark applications.

Overall, your submission meets the assignment requirements effectively. Your understanding of PySpark, Spark SQL, and data transformation concepts is evident from your work.

**FINAL GRADE**:
```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```

Keep up the excellent work! If you need any further clarification or feedback, feel free to ask.
