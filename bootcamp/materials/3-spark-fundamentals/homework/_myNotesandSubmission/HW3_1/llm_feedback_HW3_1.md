** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **



Thank you for your submission. Here is my feedback on your implementation:

1. **Disable Default Broadcast Joins**: You successfully disabled the automatic broadcast join by setting `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` to `-1`. This step is correctly implemented.

2. **Explicit Broadcast Join**: You correctly broadcasted the `medals` and `maps` tables using the `broadcast()` function. Both tables were joined appropriately with other datasets, showcasing a good understanding of explicit broadcast joins.

3. **Bucket Join**: You have implemented bucket joins on `match_details`, `matches`, and `medals_matches_players` on `match_id` with 16 buckets. The tables are correctly created and queried, indicating a solid application of bucketing.

4. **Aggregation and Analysis**:
   - **Query 4a (Player with Highest Average Kills):** Correctly computed using the average function and ordered by descending average kills per game.
   - **Query 4b (Most Played Playlist):** Correct aggregation using `countDistinct` on `match_id` and ordered by matches played.
   - **Query 4c (Most Played Map):** Proper broadcast join with the maps table; grouped and summed correctly.
   - **Query 4d (Map with Most Killing Spree Medals):** Efficient retrieval of the `killing_spree_medal_id`. The group by and sum operations are correctly applied. Good use of exception handling to manage potential data retrieval issues.

5. **Optimization with Partitioning and Sorting**: The code for optimization through partitioning and `sortWithinPartitions` is not visible in the submitted assignment. This is a critical part of the assignment and appears to be missing.

Overall, your submission demonstrates a solid understanding of PySpark data operations but has an incomplete section on partitioning and optimization, which was required by the assignment.

**Recommendations for Improvement**:
- Ensure that the partitioning and optimization section is either included or explained if it's omitted.
- Consider providing explanations or comments for optimization strategies (like partitioning) to highlight your understanding clearly.

**FINAL GRADE**:
```json
{
  "letter_grade": "B",
  "passes": true
}
```

To improve your grade, please ensure all parts of the assignment are addressed, especially the optimization task with partitioning and sorting. Feel free to resubmit after making these improvements.
