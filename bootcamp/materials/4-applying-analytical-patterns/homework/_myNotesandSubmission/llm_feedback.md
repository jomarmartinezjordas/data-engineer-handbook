Dear Student,

Thank you for submitting your advanced querying assignment. I have reviewed your queries thoroughly against the homework requirements. Here is my detailed feedback:

### Query 1: Tracking Playersâ€™ State Changes
- **Correctness:** Your approach using the `LAG` and `LEAD` window functions to determine state transitions is appropriate. The `get_season_state` function correctly maps the state transitions according to the specified criteria. However, there might be minor issues with the logic; for example, the `prev_is_active IS NULL` condition might not handle all edge cases correctly if the first active season is missing. Ensure to test with more data points to confirm the logic.
- **Efficiency:** Excellent use of window functions to handle state transitions.
- **Clarity:** The code is well structured and readable. Ensure comments adequately explain the logic and conditions, especially for non-standard SQL function implementations.

### Query 2: Aggregating with Grouping Sets
- **Correctness:** The `GROUPING SETS` are used correctly to aggregate data across the required dimensions. However, the aggregation levels seem to be only partially fulfilled, as they are not saved nor explicitly queried. Ensure the dashboard outputs align with the required aggregates.
- **Efficiency**: Good use of `GROUPING SETS` for flexibility in groupings.
- **Clarity:** Queries are well structured, and the aggregation logic is clear.

### Query 3, 4, 5: Identifying Top Performers and Teams
- **Correctness:** You correctly implemented the queries to identify the top scorers and winning teams. However, by combining these in the same file, you risk configuration issues due to dataset mismatches if tables are altered.
- **Efficiency:** Ensure indexes on foreign keys and commonly joined columns for performance improvement.
- **Clarity:** Separate concerns by isolating queries for distinct tasks to improve maintainability.

### Query 6: Calculate Most Wins in a 90-Game Stretch
- **Correctness:** This query accurately calculates maximum wins over a rolling 90-game window using window functions. Ensure that your partitioning and ordering is efficient, especially with large datasets.
- **Efficiency:** The window specification is precise. Double-check for necessary indexes to minimize scan times.
- **Clarity:** The segmentation of intermediate steps (like calculating game results) aids understanding, which is excellent.

### Query 7: Longest Streak for LeBron James
- **Correctness:** Correct usage of window functions to track game streaks for points scored by LeBron James.
- **Efficiency:** The logic seems sound, but consider any possible optimization. Review index presence on `player_name`.
- **Clarity:** The query is clear and straightforward, reflecting the correct logical flow.

### General Remarks
Your SQL skills in utilizing window functions, GROUPING SETS, and advanced state tracking are commendable. Be mindful of ensuring correctness in the logic, especially in more complex logic segments like custom PL/pgSQL functions. Always test with edge case scenarios and larger data sets to ensure robustness.

Your submission demonstrates a solid understanding of SQL techniques applied in a professional setting. Keep up the great work!

### Final Grade

```json
{
  "letter_grade": "B",
  "passes": true
}
```

To improve the grade further, I recommend refining the transition logic, enhancing documentation within the code, and separating concerns across query tasks for maintainability.
