Hello,

Thank you for your submission. Iâ€™ve reviewed your Flink job implementation and SQL script. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Python Flink Job (`HW4_1.py`)

**Correctness:**
- **Sessionization:** You have correctly implemented sessionization using a 5-minute session gap on both IP address and host. This satisfies the homework requirement.
- **Data Sink:** The job properly writes sessionized data into a PostgreSQL table.

**Code Quality:**
- **Structure and Readability:** Your code is well-structured, with logical separation in functions for source and sink creation. Logging greatly aids in readability and debugging.
- **Use of Environment Variables:** Good use of environment variables for dynamic configuration.
- **Error Handling:** You have implemented error handling, logging any exceptions that may occur.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Consider enabling checkpointing by default for production jobs if not only testing, to provide fault tolerance.
- Add more comments to explain sections of the code for more transparency, especially for people unfamiliar with pyFlink.

### SQL Script (`HW4_2.sql`)

**Correctness:**
- **Average Calculation:** You accurately calculate the average number of web events per session.
- **Host Comparison:** You correctly compare the averages for the specified hosts.

**Code Quality:**
- **Clarity and Efficiency:** The SQL queries are clean and efficient, following best practices like grouping and ordering as needed.
- **Documentation:** Decent inline comments make the intent of each query clear.

### Testing Instructions
- The submission notes do not include specific instructions for running and verifying the job and SQL script. Providing these would improve the clarity for someone testing your solution.

### Documentation
- A concise explanation of the solution is absent. Including such documentation would aid understanding of how you approached the problem and any decisions you made during development.
  
### Recommendations:
1. **Testing Instructions:** Provide clear instructions on how to run the Python script and execute the SQL queries for verification.
2. **Documentation:** Enhance the documentation to explain your implementation choices and steps.

### Final Assessment
Overall, you have met the key requirements of the assignment with a good level of code craftsmanship and problem-solving skills.

FINAL GRADE:
```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```

Keep up the good work! With a few refinements in documentation and testing, your submissions will be even stronger.
